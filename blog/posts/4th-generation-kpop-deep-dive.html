            <h1>The Ever-Evolving World of 4th Generation K-Pop (2018-Present)</h1>

            <p>The 4th Generation of K-Pop, kicking off around 2018, is the era of the digital native. These groups grew up with social media and are masters of leveraging it to build global fanbases from day one. This generation is characterized by its incredible diversity in sound, a strong emphasis on "self-production," and boundary-pushing concepts that often blur the lines between music, technology, and narrative storytelling.</p>

            <h2>Overview of the 4th Generation</h2>
            <p>If the 3rd Generation opened the doors to the West, the 4th Generation stormed right through them. Thanks to the groundwork laid by their seniors, these groups debuted with an inherent global focus. English lyrics are more common, international collaborations are frequent, and world tours are planned early in their careers. The COVID-19 pandemic also uniquely shaped this generation. With live performances halted, groups became experts at digital promotion, pioneering online concerts, virtual fan signs, and creating a wealth of reality-style content on YouTube to keep fans engaged. This has led to a K-Pop landscape that is more connected and interactive than ever before.</p>

            <h2>Major Groups & Their Activities</h2>
