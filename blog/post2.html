            <h2>The Foundation: 1st Generation (1996-2003)</h2>
            <p>The 1st Generation of K-Pop laid the very foundation of the idol industry. This era was characterized by the establishment of the "idol group" formula, heavily influenced by Japanese idols and American pop music. Groups were formed by entertainment companies, trained extensively, and debuted with catchy songs and synchronized choreography.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>H.O.T.:</strong> Often considered the first true K-Pop idol group, they debuted in 1996 and created the blueprint for future groups with their distinct member roles and trendy music.</li>
                <li><strong>S.E.S.:</strong> Debuting in 1997, they were one of the first successful female idol groups, known for their innocent image and melodic songs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sechs Kies:</strong> As the main rival to H.O.T., they showcased a more rebellious image and energetic performances.</li>
                <li><strong>Fin.K.L:</strong> Another leading girl group, they were known for their versatile concepts, ranging from sweet to charismatic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Expansion: 2nd Generation (2004-2011)</h2>
            <p>The 2nd Generation is when K-Pop began its international expansion in earnest. This era saw the rise of highly polished groups with addictive "hook songs" and a strong emphasis on global appeal. The use of YouTube and other social media platforms began to connect K-Pop with a worldwide audience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TVXQ:</strong> Known for their powerful vocals and large-scale performances, they set new standards for success in both Korea and Japan.</li>
                <li><strong>Super Junior:</strong> With their large number of members, they introduced the concept of sub-units and became immensely popular across Asia.</li>
                <li><strong>BIGBANG:</strong> They broke the traditional idol mold with their hip-hop sound and self-produced music, influencing countless artists.</li>
                <li><strong>Girls' Generation (SNSD):</strong> With their hit song "Gee," they became a cultural phenomenon and one of the most iconic girl groups in K-Pop history.</li>
                <li><strong>SHINee:</strong> Known for their complex choreography and trendsetting fashion, they were praised for their consistent quality and artistry.</li>
