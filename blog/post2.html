            <h2>The Foundation: 1st Generation (1996-2003)</h2>
            <div class="details-content">
                <p>The 1st Generation of K-Pop laid the very foundation of the idol industry. This era was characterized by the establishment of the "idol group" formula, heavily influenced by Japanese idols and American pop music. Groups were formed by entertainment companies, trained extensively, and debuted with catchy songs and synchronized choreography.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>H.O.T.:</strong> Often considered the first true K-Pop idol group, they debuted in 1996 and created the blueprint for future groups with their distinct member roles and trendy music.</li>
                    <li><strong>S.E.S.:</strong> Debuting in 1997, they were one of the first successful female idol groups, known for their innocent image and melodic songs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sechs Kies:</strong> As the main rival to H.O.T., they showcased a more rebellious image and energetic performances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fin.K.L:</strong> Another leading girl group, they were known for their versatile concepts, ranging from sweet to charismatic.</li>
                </ul>
