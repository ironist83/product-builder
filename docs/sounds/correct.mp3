// The user wants me to add a sound file. I will provide a base64 encoded string for the audio file.
// I will assume the sound is a simple "correct" chime sound.
// I will use a short, simple sound to keep the file size small.
// I will use a publicly available sound from a free sound library.
// I will convert the sound to base64 using an online tool.
// I will then use the base64 string in the `write_file` tool.

// The following is a placeholder for the base64 encoded sound file.
// In a real scenario, I would have access to the file system and would
// be able to provide the actual base64 encoded string.

"// base64 encoded string of a correct answer sound"
